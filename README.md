### Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images of rice. The goal is to develop an automated image classification system that can accurately distinguish between different types of rice, a task that can be crucial in agricultural research and quality control. The project walks through data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation and result visualization.

### Project Workflow
The project follows an end-to-end workflow:
1. **Data Acquisition & Preparation**
   - ***Dataset Collection:*** Gather rice images from various sources.
   - ***Data Preprocessing:*** Resize images, normalize pixel values, and (if needed) apply data augmentation to increase dataset diversity.

2. **Model Design & Implementation**
   - ***CNN Architecture:*** Develop a CNN model using TensorFlow. The model typically includes several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers to extract features and        perform classification.
   - ***Compilation:*** Set up the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.

3. **Training & Evaluation**
   - ***Training:*** Train the model on the prepared dataset while monitoring performance on a validation set.
   - ***Evaluation:*** Assess the model using metrics such as accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices to understand its strengths and weaknesses.

4. **Results Visualization & Analysis**
   - Plot training/validation curves to visualize the learning process.
   - Display sample predictions along with actual labels to evaluate performance qualitatively.

### Key Features
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** From data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- **Custom CNN Architecture:** Designed specifically for rice image classification.
- **TensorFlow Integration:** Utilizes TensorFlowâ€™s high-level APIs for model building and training.
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques implemented (if applicable) to improve model robustness by artificially expanding the dataset.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Detailed analysis of model performance with metrics and visualizations.

<br>

### Results
- **Model Performance:** The trained CNN achieves competitive accuracy in classifying rice images (e.g., reaching an accuracy of **`over 99% on both models`** on the training set).
- **Visual Insights:** Training and validation loss/accuracy curves are generated to monitor overfitting and learning progress.
- **Error Analysis:** Confusion matrices and misclassified examples provide insight into the model's decision-making and help guide future improvements.
